<h1>The Best Movies According to Josh McCleary</h1>
<h2>Here are my favorite movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>This movie came out the summer between my high school and college years. Tom Hanks gave one of the most memorable performances ever and the plot was unique and amazing.</p>
<h3>Rocky (1-4)</h3>
<p>One of the best underdog stories of all time. They are all great until the 5th one!</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>The writing and acting in this one put it over the top, along with the plot twist at the end.</p>
<h3>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</h3>
<p>I had to add a funny one to the list. This classic comedy has one-liners from beginning to end.</p>
